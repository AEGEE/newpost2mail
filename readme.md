## Introduction

This software is an addoptation of Stefan Hendricks' [newpost2mail for phpBB3](http://henmedia.de/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=14&Itemid=35) for AEGEE.

* Instead of HTML mails it sends text/plain,
* If the writer of a posting does not want to hide its identity, her/his name are used as sender
* The basic idea is that AEGEE members can subscribe to a mailing list, where each posting from the forum is forwarded, instead of subscribing in the forum for each topic individually.

For details, e.g. installation, see the above webpage.
